> The project is a mobile site that registers the name and age of a user through the Front-End connected as the Back-End.

## :page_facing_up: Explanation

I made a "Mobile Register" application for the Dev Club course, which works with a registration system that has the option of registering new users, showing all registered users and deleting a specific user.

I used ReactJs in the Front-End part and NodeJs (GET, POST and DELETE) in the Back-End part. The styling I used Styled Components.

## üìÅ Pages

The site has a total of 2 pages, which are:

- **Registration:** Page to register the user on the site.
- **Users:** Page showing all registered users.
